# Oblecto
## What is it?
Oblecto is a media server, similar to Plex, Emby, Netflix and others. It runs in the background on a home server to index your media such as movies and TV shows to make them searchable and streamable through a REST based interface.

## How do I set this up?
Oblecto can be installed using NPM or directly from GIT. We recommend you to install from npm if you do not intend to help with development.

Please follow the setup and installation guide here: https://github.com/robinp7720/Oblecto/wiki/Getting-Started

## I've set this thing up. Now where's the place I actually watch my media?
Simply go to the oblecto front end at ```localhost:8080```. Oblecto will redirect you to the frontend. The frontend is maintained sepperatly at https://github.com/robinp7720/Oblecto-Web
